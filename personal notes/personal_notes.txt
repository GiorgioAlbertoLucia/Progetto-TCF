Personal notes on developing some of the code


*   Least-squares polynomial fit reference (theory): https://young.physics.ucsc.edu/250/lsfit.pdf

Errors encountered:
- Including multiple times .hpp file, that have their implementation not separated from them, in the main file (e.g. including both 
    dataset.hpp and data.hpp, even though data.hpp is already included in dataset.hpp) can cause problems to the compilation. To avoid the 
    problem, always be sure to include them only once.
